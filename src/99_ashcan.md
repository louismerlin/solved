# Ashcan Challenge

You can find the ashcan comic [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/rekcah/the-future-is-ashcan/) on bhis' website.

On the second page you'll find six clocks, as well as 24 of the letters of the alphabet in a random order.

There is also a link, which gives us more hints.
Using these, we can figure out that each clock corresponds to one letter, and that each of the 24 possible clock faces corresponds to one of the letters below.

With `0:00` as the first value, corresponding to the first letter, we can figure-out that the letters will be the 8th, 10th, 18th, 13th, 22nd and 3rd.
Using these and the alphabet, we get our flag.
