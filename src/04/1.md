# SALLY Challenge #1 - EIEIO

This challenge can be found when Sally has her first chat with Wheeler.

## The Setup

> Help Sally break into the satellite and turn on Kabelo's tractor.

We are given access to a control panel URL.

## The Source

The control panel is protected by a login screen.

First thing I usually do when looking at a web page is "inspect source".

This is a hit! An HTML comment mentions a default username/password combination.
After getting access to the control panel, we flick the "Priority Override" switch, click "Apply", and we get our flag.
