# OGN Challenge #1

This challenge can be found when Dmitri aims his "smart" gun at Wheeler.

## The Setup

> Wheeler has gained access to the pirates' smart rifles via an interactive console. Help him take control of them!

You will also get a console access command that uses the `nc` (netcat) command, and a python script for the server code.

## The Decryption

Taking a look at the administrator login logic, we notice that the password that we input is compared to `admin_pw`.
This variable is computed on the fly, using a static hard-coded value.
If we execute the same computation, we should get the admin password in plaintext:

```
admin_pw_encrypted = '6d6e71775b7174727b7d6f6f536460506479774c677877656c4668727a717b40494f46565751545e'
admin_pw = ''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ i) for i, c in enumerate(bytes.fromhex(admin_pw_encrypted).decode("utf-8")))
print(admin_pw)
```

Success! The password is `most_trusted_in_the_smart_rifle_industry`.

Now, getting the flag requires you to connect to the server using the given command, pressing `2` to enter the admin login, entering the password, and then pressing `1` to activate the FRIEND-OR-FOE system.
