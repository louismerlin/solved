# WHEELER, pt. 1 Challenge #1 - DNA

This challenge can be found when Martina collects DNA samples.

## The Setup

> Martina got these 2 files from the dna scanner: dna1.txt, dna2.txt
>
> There is something more hidden in those files, can you find it?
>
> Hint: T->00, A->01, C->10, G->11

We are given two .txt files.

## The Sequence

The two text files each contain a list of [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair), for example `GC`, `TT` or `GA`.

There are 90 pairs in each sequence.

We are given the hint: T->00, A->01, C->10, G->11

Here are all of the things I tried:

- "simple" decoding
- combining the two files' columns
- taking the complement and decoding these
- doing both previous things together.

After that, I wondered "why would they give us two files?", and this is the insight that led me to the solution.

With two files, you can compare them with each other. So I did, and I noticed that at each line, either they had the same pair, or they had at least one element in common.

This led me to the solution:

1. Find positions where the two DNA files differ
2. Take only the differing bases from DNA2 (not DNA1!)
3. Convert those bases to binary using the hint (T=00, A=01, C=10, G=11)
4. Decode to ASCII

From my experience, and the experience of a lot of people on the comic's Discord, this was the hardest challenge yet.
It was frustrating to solve at times, but extremely rewarding in the end.
