# WHEELER, pt. 1 Challenge #2 - Sewer

This challenge can be found when Eli redirects all sewer traffic and creates a brown alert.

## The Setup

> At Chalon Sombreo Ski Resort, the pipes aren’t the only thing leaking, it looks like the developers’ code is springing leaks too.
>
> Can you trace the drips in their system and uncover the hidden valve control?

We are given a URL to a dashboard.

## The Docs

The first thing I do every time when given a webpage as a challenge is right-click and `View Page Source`.

Doesn't miss this time, there is an HTML comment near the bottom:

```
<!-- TODO: Developer note: for internal API docs check /docs -->
```

Nice! Checking-out the `/docs` page, we see an "admin" route called `/sewer/valve_control`.
You can either use the "Try it out" button or go to that page directly, and the flag is there on the page.
