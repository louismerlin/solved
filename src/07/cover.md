# WHEELER, pt. 2 Cover Challenge

This challenge can be found on the cover of issue 7. Spot the word **SPIRIT** followed by a sequence of `-` and `|` in the bottom right.

## The Rover

Trying to decode using many common techniques gave no useable output. I tried binary, morse and many others.

In the end, **SPIRIT** is the key. A bit of searching online (*Spirit cipher* for example) will lead you to the [Spirit DVD Code encoder/decoder](https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/spirit-dvd/) which will allow you to decode the URL that contains the flag.

It is an algorithm that was used on a code engraved on the Mars rover Spirit.

Thank you to `ROPzombie` on discord for the help with the writeup!
