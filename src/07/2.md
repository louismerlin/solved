# WHEELER, pt. 2 Challenge #2 - Stocks

This challenge can be found when [TODO].

## The Setup

> Help Wheeler dump all Reign Security Systems stock.

You are given a link to the user interface.

## The Access

We see a greyed-out page with an "Access Restricted" popup.

First instinct is right-click and "View Page Source".

The flag is right there.

You can also right-click and "Inspect", and toggle CSS properties of the main `div`s (such as untoggling `display: none` for `.flag-selection`) to see the flag appear on the page.
