# ELI Challenge #2 - Helipad

This challenge can be found when Martina jumps off a helipad.

## The Setup

> Looks like after freebooting the queue, Martina and Wheeler hid something on the Space Charging Queue panel.
>
> Can you find it yourself?

We're given a link to a web dashboard.

## The Dashboard

Taking a look at the HTML source, this looks like a React app. This means we have to go digging into the JavaScript of the page.

You should have access to [devtools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in your browser of choice.
Using the "Debugger" tab, we can inspect the source code. Both `static/js/App.js` and `static/js/index.js` do not contain anything out of the ordinary, but `static/js/components/ctfpage.jsx` has some code that clearly references the challenge.

```
useEffect(() => {
  window.getFlag = () => flag;
}, [flag]);
```

This is a fancy JavaScript way of saying "the `getFlag()` function returns the flag".

Opening up the "Console", we type `getFlag()`, press enter, and the flag is right there!

## The Search

Alternatively, you could have gone to the "Network" tab, clicked on `main.something.js`, "Response", ctrl+F and search for "KEY{" to get the flag.
