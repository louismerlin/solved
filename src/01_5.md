# OGN Challenge #5

This challenge can be found when Sally and Slim are hacking into the targeting system, the page before the terminal explodes.

## The Setup

> Help Sally and Slim disable voltage protection on the Lunar Mass Driver!

You'll find a link to a dashboard on the challenge page.

## Disabling voltage protection

Let's try going through what a user would do when faced with this dashboard:

1. There is only one button, that corresponds to what we're trying to do (*disable voltage regulation*). Click on that.
2. There is a warning dialogue about the consequences of this action. The *Yes* button is unclickable.

This is a classic CTF challenge (and security flaw in many more websites than you'd imagine): the unclickable button can actually be clicked, if you modify the page's code.
You'll need to have access to your browser's inspector. For Safari, enable Develop menu in Preferences > Advanced first. For other browsers it should be fine.
Right-click on the button, and click *Inspect*.
Notice how the *Yes (Disabled)* button tag has the `disabled=""` field attached to it.
Double-click on `disabled=""` and delete it, then press Enter.
The button is now clickable! Magic ðŸ§™

The voltage protection is now disabled, and you get a nice flag to add to your collection ðŸš©
