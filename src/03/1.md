# ELI Challenge #1 - Sneaks

This challenge can be found when Eli takes care of sneaky-sneaks trying to breach into Säkerhetsbubbla.

## The Setup

> There's some service running on a port it wasn't originally meant to run on, on this host...
>
> Help Eli find the service that doesn't follow the rules and it'll give you the flag. The flag will be in format KEY{...}
>
> (no need to scan all ports, just the first 100 + hint: it's running as the anonymous user)

## The Ports

First, we need to figure out the IP address we'll have to scan. Using a CLI utility such as `dig` or `ping` will help. Remember you should only give these tools the **domain name**, without the path.

I've replaced the IP address with X.XX.XX.XXX for the rest of this article, in case it changes in the future.

Now, we can use `nmap` to scan the first 100 ports and see what is open.

```
$ nmap -p 1-100 X.XX.XX.XXX
...
80/tcp open  http
99/tcp open  metagram
```

The HTTP server on port 80 is the one we'd expect for a website, so the flag must be somewhere behind port 99. `metagram` doesn't ring a bell, but let's just cURL what's there.

```
$ curl X.XX.XX.XXX:99
curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed
```

No luck. Second thing to try after cURL is always ncat:

```
$ ncat X.XX.XX.XXX 99

Awesome! Let's ftp into that server then.

## The Cat

After a bit of trial and error, I figured out you needed the `-p` "passive" flag in order for everything to work properly.

```
$ ftp -p X.XX.XX.XXX 99
Connected to X.XX.XX.XXX.
