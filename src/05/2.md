# ART/ARF Challenge #2 - Fire

This challenge can be found when Wheeler uses a fireball spell against a door.

## The Setup

> Our team found this building's outdated Document Management System.
>
> It shares a similar vulnerability as the building itself... the password hasn't been changed for a long time.
>
> Help Wheeler, Eli, Martina, Art and Sally find the flag located inside the DMS.

We are given a URL to a login page.

## The Login

The login page is for some software called "OpenKM", which is using "jsp", Java Server Pages, which to me screams "corporate infrastructure".

First thing I try is `admin`/`admin` and `root`/`root`, but no luck.

Second thing is I look up "openkm default password", which gets me to the [okm quick start page](https://docs.openkm.com/kcenter/view/okm-6.3-com/quick-start.html), which states:

> The default administrator credentials are:
>
> - **Username**: okmAdmin
> - **Password**: admin
>
> Do not forget to **change the administrator password**.

You guessed it, like in all good corporate infrastructure, they did not change the administrator password.

In the next page we are able to download `flag.txt`, which contains our flag.
