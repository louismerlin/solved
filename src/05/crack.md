# ART/ARF Crack the \*\*\*\*\*\*

This challenge can be found on the inside of the cover of issue 5.

## The Pattern

We are given an image of alien-looking symetrical symbols.

At first I tried doing some image modifications on the image, as it seems to be split-up in quadrants.
I tried moving the top third of the image to the left and right, the bottom third of the image to the left and right (using gimp), but this did not make it look like any symbol I recognized.

Finally, like I often do, I turned to [dcode's symbols cipher list](https://www.dcode.fr/symbols-ciphers), which made me discover the [betamaze cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/betamaze-cipher), which is the code used for this challenge!
