# OGN Challenge #7

This challenge can be found where Roanoke gives Wheeler a wallet ID.

## The Setup

> Wheeler wants to transfer the funds from the card, but we need some personal information. The account seems to be linked to Darius Gift, who had an obituary published recently. Can you gather the information we need and gain access to the funds?

You'll find two key pieces in the comic and on the webpage:
1. A **barcode** containing encoded card data
2. A link to **Tropic Bank's transfer form**

The challenge also provides this Python script (`encoder.py`):

```python
# pip install msgpack 
import msgpack
import base64

card_data = {
    "card": 12345678900000,
    "pin": "1a2b3c"
}

packed = msgpack.packb(card_data)
encoded = base64.b64encode(packed)

```

## What the Bank Form Requires

The transfer form needs these four pieces of information:

- **Sender Account Number**
- What is the **name** of your current agent?
- What **city** do you currently live in?
- What is the **title** of your first published work?

### Part 1: Decoding the Card Data


The barcode gives us encoded information. When we scan it with a [barcode scanner](https://barcodescanneronline.com/), we get: `gqRjYXJkzwAAIYgxWHbco3Bpbs0SmA==`

This looks like base64-encoded data! Looking at the `encoder.py` script, we can see the encoding process:
1. Pack data with MessagePack 
2. Encode result with Base64

To reverse this process:
```
Base64::encode(MessagePack::pack(data))
becomes
MessagePack::unpack(Base64::decode(data))
```

Using [CyberChef to decode](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)From_MessagePack()&input=Z3FSallYSmt6d0FBSVlneFdIYmNvM0JwYnMwU21BPT0&oeol=VT), we get:

```json
{
    "card": 36868827150044,
    "pin": 4760
}
```

Perfect! The sender account number is **36868827150044**.

### Part 2: Finding Darius Gift's Personal Info

The remaining three security questions can be answered by locating Darius Gift's obituary in the comic.
You can find it a few pages before the challenge's indicator.

- **Agent name**: David Lebling II
- **Current city**: Bangkok 
- **First published work title**: The Shadow Factory

### Part 3: Completing the Transfer

Once we have all four pieces of information, we can fill out the Tropic Bank form and complete the fund transfer.

The interface asks us for a **pin**, which we have decoded previously as part of the card data: **4760**.

Congrats, we've got the flag!
