# OGN Challenge #2

This challenge can be found when two employees of the Mass Driver Facility in Hawaii are discussing clicking on a random email.

## The Setup

> Looks like one of our employees at the Hawaii Mass Driver Facility got tricked into handing over their personal information.

You are also given an email file to analyze.

## The Attachment

Running `strings` on `email.eml` doesn't yield useful results.

You can open the email with [Thunderbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird) or an [online eml reader](https://www.emlreader.com/).

The email contains an attachment: `PRIZE_ACCEPTANCE_FORM.docm`.

## The Macro

Running `strings` on `PRIZE_ACCEPTANCE_FORM.docm` also produces no useful output, but the document mentions enabling macros.

In [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice) Writer:

1. Open the document
2. Go to **Tools > Macros > Edit Macros**
3. In the dropdown menu, select **\[PRIZE_ACCEPTANCE_FORM.docm\].Project**

The flag appears embedded in a Google search URL within the macro code.

  <p>`strings` doesn't always work on file formats like .docm files - sometimes you need to open them up and poke around! This is also why real hackers often use Office macros to pwn their targets.</p>
